# Module 1

Is the market more responsive to bad news as opposed to good news? Restoring from a recent financial crisis in 2008, the world witnessed a volatile stock market - in particular, in the notion of the financial sector - during the period of 2008 to 2013. One perhaps might inevitably wonder, “In chain of unprecedented bad news in that meltdown, has the market suffered from an everlasting increased systemic risk in contrast to pre-event state?” Looking at the historical quotes of global stock market indices (e.g. SP500, DJ, NASDAQ), we attempted to identify world-renown infamous financial crisis (such as dot-com and sub-prime) occurred during the last decades - in particular, the late 90’s and 00’s. On the above datasets, we applied time-series analytics (such as ARIMA and GARCH) to construct models, which can illustrate then-market volatilities with their corresponding parameters. Then, we compared the above figures against those of the pre-event times, referred as the control group.

# Module 2

The Weekend Effect is defined as, "A phenomenon in financial markets in which stock returns on Mondays are often significantly lower than those of the immediate preceding Fridays." Some theories that explain the effect attribute the tendency for companies to release bad news on Friday after the markets close to depressed stock prices on Monday. However, the others do not acknowledge such weekly tendencies and stated that it may be a pure stochastic event. In this module, we intend to employ a series of conventional statistical methods to analyze whether or not the stock market, resembled by the S&P500 Index, exhibited a tendency against the weekend evenings. Our intention is to change minds of the traders who believe in the Weekend Effect.
