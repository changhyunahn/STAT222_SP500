# STAT222 Research on S&P 500 Index

Abstract of our research

Is the market more responsive to bad news as opposed to good news? Restoring from a recent financial crisis in 2008, the world witnessed a volatile stock market - in particular, in the notion of the financial sector - during the period of 2008 to 2013. One perhaps might inevitably wonder, “In chain of unprecedented bad news in that meltdown, has the market suffered from an everlasting increased systemic risk in contrast to pre-event state?” Looking at the historical quotes of global stock market indices (e.g. SP500, DJ, NASDAQ), we attempted to identify world-renown infamous financial crisis (such as dot-com and sub-prime) occurred during the last decades - in particular, the late 90’s and 00’s. On the above datasets, we applied time-series analytics (such as ARIMA and GARCH) to construct models, which can illustrate then-market volatilities with their corresponding parameters. Then, we compared the above figures against those of the pre-event times, referred as the control group.
